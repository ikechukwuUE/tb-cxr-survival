# TB Chest X-Ray Survival Modeling

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether baseline chest X-ray features combined with clinical covariates can predict time to major complication or death in adults with suspected or confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.

## Framework
- Multimodal deep learning
- Survival analysis
- Explainable AI
- Kaggle-based execution
- Research-grade reproducibility

## Structure
- `src/`: core modeling and utility code
- `notebooks/`: orchestration notebooks
- `data/`: raw and processed data (not tracked)
- `outputs/`: model artifacts and figures

## Status
Project setup phase.
